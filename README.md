# rock_paper_scissors
My First JavaScript Project!

This is my first every JavaScript "project"!
I'm going to create a rock, paper, scissors game via the browser console. Standard first program so let's start.

Adding in the UI kinda messed up my whole system here.. I went ahead and nulled all functions and am starting from scratch focusing on getting the interface right. Ill add them back in later.
