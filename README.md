My First JavaScript Project!

This is my first every JavaScript "project"!
I'm going to create a rock, paper, scissors game via the browser console. Standard first program so let's start.

Adding in the UI kinda messed up my whole system here.. I went ahead and nulled all functions and am starting from scratch focusing on getting the interface right. Ill add them back in later.

So, I completed my first javascript project and it was really fun! I took about 2 weeks off of coding for my bday and graduation and I thought jumping back in was going to be difficult but it actually felt even easier than when I was pushing coding every day. NICE! I learned how to use the DOM to create an interface and brushed up on some css in this one. I also learned how to create a separate branch using git and cycle between branches and merge them later. Good project overall!
